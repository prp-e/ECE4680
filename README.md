#MIPS ECE4680 

This is my very first experience in hardware implementation, I always liked
to know how a CPU works, and the best way to understand it, is making one!
I found how to implement a __MIPS ECE4680__ CPU, and I did it. 
Hope you enjoy :)

## How to test?

Just compile codes, first install `iverilog` package and then :

```
 iverilog -o MIPS-ECE4680 *.v

```

Then :

```
 vvp ./MIPS-ECE4680
```
